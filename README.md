<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The purpose of the MQT is to provide a statistical representation of climate data
from 30 years ago to today from numerous meteorological stations across the United States. This is 
done though the use of the National Climate Data Center's database and a web application to provide 
a seamless user interface. All queries are conducted in log(n) time complexity due to the use of SQL
indexes. The user can query data from a specific date or create a visualization of climate trends
using the Matplotlib library.

### Inspiration
While researching for COVID-19 data, I noticed that all of the popular visualization resources either only showed the [current situation](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html), or showed a [quick timeline](https://kitware.github.io/covid-19-vis/). This is not very helpful for researching the number of cases in a specific county on any day as it provides too general of a visualization. Thus, I created a day-by-day visualization tool that allows researchers to query the data for a specific day in a user friendly and visually appealing way.

### What it does
This is a web API to allow the user to visualize a snapshot of the COVID-19 situation in the USA on a specific day. The user can see exactly how many cases there were in a specific county in this snapshot of time. 

### How I built it
This application is built using Dash with Python, the Plotly library to generate the choropleth map, and the Bootstrap framework to quickly develop the CSS. The New York Time's COVID-19 dataset was used along with a JSON map of the United States from Plotly.

### Challenges I ran into
It was difficult to actually find the data in a usable form online, because it was either fragmented or contained irrelevant data to my purpose. This introduced me to the pandas libraries to clean and filter the dataset. I've also never worked with visualizations of datasets before, so the hardest part was actually starting.

### Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I created my first deployable web API and made a visually appealing application to solve a real world problem, while introducing me to data science concepts along the way.

### What I learned
I learned the fundamentals of data science through cleaning and filtering data and how to make useful visualizations by taking advantage of python's many data science libraries. I also learned how to use a new web application framework with Dash.


### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Flask](https://plotly.com/dash)
* [SQLite](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [Bootstrap](https://bootstrap.com)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com)


## Getting Started

No API key is needed to access the tool, so the application may be locally run through the python file.

### Prerequisites

The flask framework must be installed as a prerequisite.
* pip
  ```sh
  pip install requirements.txt
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/cjoshi7/covid19-date-selector
   ```
2. Install prerequisites
   ```sh
   pip install requirements.txt
   ```
4. Begin a flask development server
   ```JS
   flask run
   ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This tool can be used for research purposes to find the exact number of cases in a specific county on any day. It is useful to see the patterns of infection and death rate increases/decreases. For example, it can be seen that the number of infections skyrocketed in early January after the holiday season. The tool is useful for establishing patterns such as this.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

__See the [open issues](https://github.com/cjoshi7/covid19-date-selector) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).__
## TODO ##
    -Manipulate the DOM using jQuery and AJAX calls. When the submit button is pressed,
    make a GET request to the server using the input fields.
    PROBLEM: When the HTML form is submitted, the corresponding JS event listener does
    not reccognize the event, likely due to syntax error because of confusion between
    element vs id JS syntax. Figure out how to properly select DOM elements.

    -Allow a range of dates to be selected on the HTML file and render coordinate plot
    using the database response. Use this instead of table.

    -Change the padding and color of the Bootstrap classes in styles.css to center the
    input fields and make the background sky blue.
<br>
<p>
  The following features will be implemented in the indefinite future:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Expanded dataset to include:
      <ul>
        <li>Mask usage</li>
        <li>Population density</li>
        <li>Demographic breakdown</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Dark theme through altered CSS</li>
    <li>An option to use the program in the command line</li>
  </ol>
</p>
